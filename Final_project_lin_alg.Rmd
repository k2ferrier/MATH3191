Import Data:
```{r}
# Import data from web as a dataframe
moles <- read.csv("https://ucdenver.instructure.com/courses/421765/files/9196715/download?wrap=1")
```

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
```{r}
# Select only the columns needed for analysis. Individuals with missing data are ommitted and columns renamed for aesthetic purposes. PCA is not possible with factored/categorical data, so genotype, gender, eyecolor, and haircolor have continuous scale dummy variables (where genotype: 0 = gg, 1 = ga, 2 = aa, gender: 1 = female, 2 = male, hispanic: 0 = non-Hispanic, 1 = Hispanic, eyecolor: 1 = blue, green, or combo, 2 = light/dark brown, 3 = hazel, haircolor: 1 = blonde, 2 = red, 3 = brown, 4 = black).
moles_3 <- moles %>% 
  select(oca2.status, gender, eyecolor, haircolor, baseskincolor, hispanic, molecount2008, number.vacs..birth.thru.2007) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename("genotype" = oca2.status) %>% 
  rename("n_vacations" = number.vacs..birth.thru.2007) %>% 
  rename("mole_count" = molecount2008)

# Perform PCA on the moles dataset
pca <- princomp(moles_3, cor = T) # The correlation matrix is used to perform the PCA. This is equivalent to standardizing each variable to mean 0 and standard deviation of 1, which helps account for the difference in scales between variables.

# Create a scree plot to view the variance explained as a function of number of PCs.
scree_plot <- fviz_eig(pca)
scree_plot

# Plot the PC scores of each individual vs loadings of variables for PCs 1 and 2.
groups <- as.factor(moles_3$genotype) # factor the genotypes to use as a grouping factor in the biplot
fviz_pca_biplot(pca, 
             col.ind = groups,
             col.var = "black",
             addEllipses = T,
             palette = "dark2",
             label = "var"
             )

```


Principal Component Regression (PCR):
```{r}
# Select only the columns needed for analysis. Individuals with missing data are ommitted and columns are renamed for aesthetic purposes. The genotype variable is changed from dummy variables to factored/categorical variables so that each genotype can be considered separately.
moles_2 <- moles %>% 
  select(oca2.status, gender, eyecolor, haircolor, baseskincolor, hispanic, molecount2008, number.vacs..birth.thru.2007) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  rename("genotype" = oca2.status) %>% 
  mutate(genotype = case_when(
    genotype == 0 ~ "gg",
    genotype == 1 ~ "ga",
    genotype == 2 ~ "aa")) %>%  
  rename("n_vacations" = number.vacs..birth.thru.2007) %>% 
  rename("mole_count" = molecount2008)

# Perform PCR
pcr <- pcr(data = moles_2, mole_count~., scale = T, validation = "CV") # create a PCR object. The response variable being modeled is mole count as described by all other variables. The variables are scaled according to their variance. 
summary(pcr)

# Plot of root mean squared error as a function of number of PCs included.
plot(RMSEP(pcr), main = "Mole Count PCR Scree Plot")

# Plot of the linear regression using 5 PCs on mole count.
plot(pcr, ncomp = 5, line = T, main = "PC Regression (n=5) on Mole Count", ylab = "residuals", xlab = "mole count")

# Percent Variance explained by each PC in table format
explvar(pcr)

# Estimated coefficients (Betas) for each variable in the model
coef(pcr)
```

Partial Least Squares (PLS):
```{r}
# Run a partial least squares regression on the moles data using the same data as for the PCR analysis.
pls <- plsr(data = moles_2, mole_count~. , validation = "LOO")
summary(pls)

# Plot of root mean squared error as a function of number of PCs included.
plot(RMSEP(pls), main = "Mole Count PLS Scree Plot")

# Percent Variance explained by each PC in table format
explvar(pls)

# Estimated coefficients (Betas) for each variable in the model
coef(pls)
```

Multivariate Linear Regression
```{r}
# Oridinary Least Squares Regression of Mole count as explained by genotype, gender, ethnicity (hispanic), number of vacations, eye color, hair color, and base skin color
mlr <- lm(data = moles_2, formula = mole_count ~ genotype + gender + hispanic + n_vacations + eyecolor + haircolor + baseskincolor)
summary(mlr)
```
